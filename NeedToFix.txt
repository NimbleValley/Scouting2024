---- ISSUES ----

Breakdowns take too long to run, why is the setup called multiple times? 
Also team data doesn't need to populate rows for breakdown, useless waste of time 

Team highlight automatically highlights headers in team data tab

Generally remove every reference to a grid



---- NEW FEATURES ----

Add features to pick list tab, such as data comparisons & auto sort

Make autos more stimulating, maybe a drag and drop to visualize paths???



---- UPDATE OLD FEATURES ----

Make compare tab useful 

If time make match tab functional?

Migrate graph tab to a canvas element or use a library - Definately needs rework

Take a look at the sorting parameters, they seem strange & unnecessary
