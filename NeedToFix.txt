---- ISSUES ----

Team highlight automatically highlights headers in team data tab

Breakdowns don't work

Generally remove every reference to a grid

Remove unused parameter 'team' in function getSortedIndex



---- NEW FEATURES ----

Add features to pick list tab, such as data comparisons & auto sort

Make autos more stimulating, maybe a drag and drop to visualize paths???



---- UPDATE OLD FEATURES ----

Make compare tab useful 

If time make match tab functional?

Migrate graph tab to a canvas element or use a library - Definately needs rework

Take a look at the sorting parameters, they seem strange & unnecessary
