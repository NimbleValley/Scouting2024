---- ISSUES ----

Breakdowns take too long to run, why is the setup called multiple times? 
Also team data doesn't need to populate rows for breakdown, useless waste of time 



---- NEW FEATURES ----

ADD SPIDER GRAPHS

Add team similarity insights

Add features to pick list tab, such as data comparisons & auto sort

Make autos more stimulating, maybe a drag and drop to visualize paths???



---- UPDATE OLD FEATURES ----

Merge comparisons with graph tab probably

If time make match tab functional?

Take a look at the sorting parameters, they seem strange & unnecessary
