---- ISSUES ----

Sometimes dorting takes multiple clicks in team tab, check localStorage?

Breakdowns take too long to run, why is the setup called multiple times? 
Also team data doesn't need to populate rows for breakdown, useless waste of time 



---- NEW FEATURES ----

ADD SPIDER GRAPHS

ADD CONSISTANCY FOR EVERY STAT, SHOW TRENDS

Add team similarity insights

Add features to pick list tab, such as data comparisons & auto sort

Make autos more stimulating, maybe a drag and drop to visualize paths???



---- UPDATE OLD FEATURES ----

Make compare tab useful 

If time make match tab functional?

Migrate graph tab to a canvas element or use a library - Definately needs rework

Take a look at the sorting parameters, they seem strange & unnecessary
